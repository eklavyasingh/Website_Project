    <h3 class="subt">Structural modeling and analysis</h3>
    <p class="datestamp">30 July 2022</p>
    <p class="textpara">
      Mining draglines are large mining machines which have a boom of about 100
      m in length. The booms are tubular structures made up of three large
      chords connected by smaller lacing tubes. There is a regular cracking
      phenomenon at the welds which means that the cracking must be remotely
      detected, exactly located and repaired. In this study, the
      three-dimensional (3D) dynamic dragline models are developed for
      investigating the dynamic dragline performance and front-end structural
      strength. A virtual prototype of the dragline is created by the dynamic
      integration of the mechanical model of the dragline boom. The model is
      evaluated for failures due to static loading and the points of failure are
      indentified.After the identification of the point, modifications are made
      to the joint with the highest failure probability. The method is
      manufacture of a separate block and the tubes to be welded on that block.
      This gives more thickness to the most critical points providing better
      strength and longer life of the boom.

      A dragline is a large rotating multi-body system to remove overburden in
      surface mining environment. The repeated dynamic, instantaneous loading
      accumulates over the dragline service life, and it may induce front-end
      damage. Fatigue failure in components causes unplanned downtimes, reduced
      efficiency and high production costs. The primary objective of this study
      is to examine dragline front-end life towards efficient operation. The
      structural loading on dragline front-end depends mainly on the rated
      suspended load, and the accelerations created by hoist and swing motors.
      Other factors such as the digging pattern, operator characteristics and
      electrical motor control systems also influence the loading on front-end.
      In order to calculate the overall stress loading of front-end, it is
      necessary to build the dragline virtual prototype just as to build a
      physical prototype. For this purpose, 3D dynamics of the dragline must be
      modeled and analyzed. Conventional design process uses a laboratory test
      to simulate the dragline front-end to detect the cracking for the
      reduction of component fatigue failure. This process is very costly and
      time-consuming for achieving statistically significant basis for
      evaluation and subsequent decisions. Previous researchers have developed a
      dynamic model in dragline operation and studied the component fatigue
      failure by the field-testing data or recently, virtual prototype
      simulators have been used to simulate surface mining equipment Modern
      design processes in virtual simulation environments enable the testing of
      machine performance and component fatigue failure prior to final design
      and field-testing. One of the observed failures of this machine is in the
      welds of its booms. This causes a halt in production and may cause
      accidents. A weak weld may cause it to damage soon lowering the production
      of the quarry. This project is a step towards improving the strength of
      the joints and making them less prone to failure. Elements of the boom are
      welded on the main pipe at junctions. These junctions are an intersection
      of 4 to 6 elements. Observing the joint, we can see how these are welded
      overlapping on each other. These overlapping welds create sharp angles and
      lead to increase in stress concentration on the welds. This leads to
      premature failure of the welds. The main task is to identify the joints
      which suffer maximum stresses. For the analysis we created a boom using
      Ansys 15.0 and fixed its one end like in dragline and applied the force on
      the other end (i.e. where bucket is attached). After doing the analysis we
      get about four to five joints of maximum stresses and these joints are
      prone to failure of the welds. This can be improved by welding the
      elements on a block welded to the main pipe. This reduces the stress
      concentration of the junction. Also the welds are perpendicular to the
      elements hence the force acts perpendicular to them. There is no shear
      component acting on the joints. Thus it leads to lowering of chances of
      failure of the weld. The block to be welded on main pipe should be welded
      during the manufacturing of boom. This will of course increase the weight
      and cost but it also increases the boom life, resulting in higher
      productivity due to less failures.

      Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic diagram of walking dragline. The lower body
      provides a stable base for the dragline. The upper body provides a
      platform for the hoist-drag-swing machinery, boom and tri-stricture
      attachment, electronic control cabinets, operatorâ€™s cab and supporting
      equipment. The front-end mechanism consists of a large bucket which is
      suspended from a boom with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered by hoist
      and drag ropes, powered by electric motors. The work cycle of the dragline
      consists of three distinct phases, including digging, swinging, and
      swinging back. In a digging phase, the bucket is positioned above the
      material to be excavated. Then, the bucket is lowered and the drag rope is
      drawn so that the bucket is dragged along the surface of the material. The
      bucket is lifted by using the hoist rope. A swing operation is performed
      to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The
      drag rope is released causing the bucket to tilt and empty by the dump
      operation. Finally, the bucket is swung back to repeat the cycle.

      On the points A and B bearing loads of 400000 N are applied as shown in
      the figure. The lower part of the dragline boom is fixed to the main frame
      at points C, D, E and F. Usually this part is hinged and is rotatable, but
      for simplification of design, four fixed points are considered. They will
      be static points and not allowed movement in any coordinate of any amount
      of rotation. The strains in the boom are not considered to move these
      points. While the rest of the boom is free to move due to the load acting
      on the top points A and B.

      Continuous subjection to stress cycles causes fatigue failure. Forces
      acting through the hoist ropes and the inertia forces due to accelerations
      contribute to fatigue failure. The location of the cracking is often
      embedded underneath the lacing. Main chords are pressurised with air so
      that cracks can be detected using loss of air pressure. The analysis of
      results and proper inspection shows that the points of most common and
      frequent failures are the weld points. This conclusion coincides with the
      observation in the industry. Several dragline booms face the failure at
      their weld points in the industry. One the reason is the steep angles in
      the weld which leads to stress concentration effects in the weld. Several
      tubes need to be welded at the same point to form the truss required.
      Large number of tubes led to packing in the joint and tubes being placed
      at very small angles to each other. Also there are deformations due to
      heating and cooling caused by the welding which affects the stress
      concentration. The point of maximum stress is observed to be in the
      junction where the pipes are welded onto each other. The overlapping of
      the pipes creates sharp angles leading to increment in stress
      concentration in the joint.
      <img class="artimg" src="images/image020.png" />
    </p>
    <p class="textpara">
      Observations verify the failure of joints in the welded areas. One more
      reason being the increase in brittleness and decrease of strength in the
      heat affected zone. Also the amount of skill and time required to weld a
      conventional joint is high. There are curved surfaces and the ends of the
      pipes also have to be cut in curves for it to perfectly fit onto the
      surface of the main pipe and be welded on it. Thus one of the ways to make
      the joints stronger is improving the geometry of the welds in the truss.
      The method is to have a preformed hollow block and members of the truss be
      welded on this block. To reduce failure we can use a metal block during
      manufacturing of boom.Solid joint section with pipes welded on it rather
      than welding the pipes onto one another. Due to larger cross sectional
      area, the stress is less on the joint. There shall be hollow cavity in the
      section to allow inspection gases to pass. The weld block is to be
      manufactured by casting. The dimensions and angles of the block are to be
      determined from the initial welding of the truss elements without the
      block. The model of the junction structure is to be made.
    </p>
    <ul class="textpara">
      <li>
        Then the joint section is to be made such that the surface of the block
        is normal to the truss element to be welded onto it.
      </li>
      <li>The line of forces acting on the elements must be co-incident.</li>

      The affects caused by this change in design: â€¢ As the life of weakest
      joints is increased, so life of boom increases. The joint is strengthened
      and its reliability increases. The rate of failure decreases and the time
      to next maintenance increases. â€¢ Material lifting capacity increases. The
      overall lifting capacity of the boom improves as this design gives more
      strength to the joint â€¢ The manufacturing process gets more complex as we
      need detailed measurements and angles of the surface of the block has to
      be perfect. As we are adding material, so weight of boom increases. Cost
      of manufacturing increases. â€¢ Production: Joint blocks to be casted, each
      with specification of number of elements it is to be joined with and the
      angle of joint. The optimization of the production of blocks can be made
      based on the symmetry of the joints in the truss Pipes to be then welded
      on the blocks.
