      Wheelchairs have been a symbol of empowerment and independence to the
      differently-abled through the years. These machines have given people
      mobility without the need to depend on anyone else. There have been
      several developments and changes in these machines since they were first
      used. Developments like motorization and automation have made them more
      dependable. But for the less fortunate parts of the society, they would
      consume large parts of their income. The weaker sections of our society
      seldom have the freedom to choose a wheelchair of their needs. The first
      reason is that most of the wheelchairs are designed for urban homes and
      offices. Rarely wheelchairs are seen in rural areas and outdoors where the
      roads are rough and dusty. The second reason is that they cannot afford
      wheelchairs and their maintenance. There is need of a Tricycle that is
      made in accordance to both the aspects of the situation.
    </p>
    <p class="textpara">
      The proposed design is a hybrid of hand powered and electric tricycle.
      Large front wheels make moving in rough terrains easy. The battery
      provides backup of several hours. The electric motor powers the Tricycle
      and reduces the efforts of the driver. The seat is comfortable and
      adjustable according to the userâ€™s height. The frame is sturdy and
      durable. The weight is distributed equally to the wheels. The whole system
      is designed to require minimum maintenance. The front wheel is hand
      powered. The handle connected to a chain is rotated by the user which
      powers the front wheel. The rear wheels can be powered by an electric
      motor placed under the seat. The power is transferred from the motor to
      the wheels by a small speed reduction gearbox connecting the axle. The
      motor can be switched on or off depending on the need of the user. The
      simultaneous power supply from both motor and the user will reduce effort
      to be applied by the user. The user can also choose not to hand pedal the
      Tricycle for certain intervals of time.
